# Stanford Reconstruction

**Python scripts for surface reconstruction of range scans** provided in "[The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)"

## Alignment
Note that original `.conf` file of **bunny** has wrong parameters `qw`. I changed the sign of `qw` in my script file, so that we can get the correct registration.
```
bash ./bunny.sh
```
